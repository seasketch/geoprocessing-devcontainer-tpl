Geoprocessing Devcontainer
=====

Provides a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) for developing geoprocessing projects in a stable container environment on top of [geoprocessing-workspace](https://github.com/seasketch/docker-gp-workspace).

This is a template.  It is designed for you to make a copy and populate it with your own geoprocessing projects, stored within your own Github organization.

If you are part of the SeaSketch organization you should be using the [SeaSketch geoprocessing devcontainer](https://github.com/seasketch/geoprocessing-devcontainer), which was created from this template. Instructions to use it are part of the standard [tutorial](https://github.com/seasketch/geoprocessing/wiki/Tutorials).
